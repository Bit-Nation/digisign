/* pseudo code */
/*
so maybe

screen 1) upload file, screen

2) enter keypair


like (insert keypair from file, or paste them) and (I dont have them/dont understand what it is --  so generate)

screen 3) enter password â€¦.


--> which generates us a JSON object {1) the hash of the file 2) the signing of the hash by the secret key 3) the public key}

the final page will display that JSON object and the tx id
